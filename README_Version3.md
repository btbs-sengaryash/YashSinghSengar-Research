# Computational Chemistry & Biophysics Projects

This repository highlights selected scripts, workflows, and examples from my research and internships in **computational chemistry and biology**.  
The projects demonstrate my experience with **Molecular Dynamics (MD), QM/MM simulations, DFT, and Python-based automation** in the context of protein dynamics and drug discovery.
